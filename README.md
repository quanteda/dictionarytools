An R package consisting of dictionaries for text analysis and associated
utilities. Designed to be used with [**quanteda**](http://quanteda.io)
but can be used more generally with any text analytic package
(e.g.Â **tidytext**, **tm**, etc.).

## Installing

``` r
# the devtools package needs to be installed for this to work
devtools::install_github("quanteda/dictionarytools") 
```

## Plans

To do list includes adding functions that: - allow us to convert a
wild-card or regex dictionary into a fixed match dictionary, for the
supported languages (English, initially); - expand a core word list
through synonyms using the **wordnet** package; - expand a core word
list through (e.g.) cosine similarities to other words from a corpus; -
expand a core word list through word2vec vector proximities to other
words from a corpus; - allow easy editing of dictionaries via a
round-trip to the editor.
